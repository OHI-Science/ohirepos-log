# Creating OHI repos

This is how you create OHI repos using the package `ohirepos`. 


# Create repo on GitHub.com and register repo

There are two things you need to do before executing the script below. 

1. Make a repository on GitHub.com. You'll need a GitHub account and if you're making the repo within the [OHI-Science](https://github.com/OHI-Science) organization you'll need administration privileges. We typically make OHI repos with short, 3-letter keys, for example `bhi` and `gye`.

2. Add info by hand to `ohirepos-log/repo_registry.csv`. To create a Starter Repo with only a prep folder, all you need to input are the first two columns (`study_key` and `study_area`). Make sure the `study_key` is what you named your GitHub repository. If you're making a Full Repo, you'll need to provide a filepath for shapefiles. Additionally, if you want to populate the repo with data from global assessments, check `ohirepos-log/rgn_global.csv` to cross-check global name and rgn_id to populate the repo. See the OHI Manual section on [requesting your repositories](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#requesting-your-repositories) for more information between the Starter Repo and the Full Repo.

Now you're ready for R. 

# Initial Setup

## Assign variables

You will need to assign two variables based on the repository you want to created. Once you set these variables you'll be able to run this code chunk.

1. your repo's key — the same one that you set above and registered in `repo_registry`
2. a temporary directory where you want to work locally on your computer

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}

## you set these variables
key <- 'test3'
dir_temp <- '~/github/clip-n-ship'


## load libraries
devtools::install_github("ohi-science/ohicore@dev")
devtools::load_all('~/github/ohirepos') # or devtools::install_github("ohi-science/ohirepos")
library(ohirepos) 
library(tidyverse)


## read in repo registry information, add working directory 
repo_registry <- readr::read_csv('repo_registry.csv') %>%
  dplyr::filter(study_key == key) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(dir_repo = file.path(dir_temp, key))


## create working dir if it doesn't already exist
if(!file.exists(repo_registry$dir_repo)) dir.create(repo_registry$dir_repo)


# dir_work <- path.expand('~/github/ohi-webapps') # get rid of any reliance on ohi-webapps
## load this stuff from ohirepos.
# source(file.path(dir_work, 'common.r'))
# source(file.path(dir_work, 'create_init_sc.R'))

```


# Populate the Starter Repo

The Starter Repo has some initial files including a README, as well as a `prep` folder with sub-folders for every goal and sub-goal. Additionally, create and push the project website. The default for these functions is to push updates to github.com/ohi-science/[key].

If you need to unpopulate an existing repo, there are instructions below. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## populate the prep repo — create a repo object for the master branch 
repo <- ohirepos::populate_init(repo_registry, push = TRUE)
repo <- ohirepos::populate_prep(repo_registry, push = TRUE)

## deploy the website — don't create a repo object because it's a gh-pages branch
ohirepos::deploy_website(repo_registry, push = TRUE) 

```

# Populate Full Repo

You'll need to fill out all fields in `repo_registry.csv` to populate the Full Repo. You can choose the origin of the files you'll copy (it defaults to ohi-global). You have to make sure there a copy of the origin repo cloned locally. 

populate layers folder and layers.csv, this will also create the scenario folder. And then create conf.  Run these in order.

This doesn't push, just populates. --> keep this?

If you need to unpopulate your repo's scenario folder if you've redefined regions or something, clone it locally and pull, delete the senario folder, and then continue here. 

You'll run these as a suite of things, so just clone during populate_layers and push as the final move after the check.

```{r populate, eval=FALSE}

repo <- ohirepos::populate_layers(repo_registry, multi_nation = FALSE)
  ## TODO come back here to make sure the empty layers don't cause a problem (removed swapping global mean stuff); still clean up.

populate_conf(repo_registry)

populate_etc(repo_registry)
  ## TODO: add viz

## create repo's maps
create_repo_map(key, dir_spatial, dir_scenario)
## TODO, check this out again! Haven't yet in the July 2017 
# -->> will need to ## Inspect user's shapefiles and save as OHI shapefiles

```


## Calculate scores and create scores.csv
Can also test this from the repo itself (open the the clip-n-ship/key/.rproj)

```{r calculate, eval=FALSE}

## calculate scores # TODO: remove ohicore@dev dependency
calculate_scores_check(repo_registry)


## and push!
commit_and_push(repo_registry, 
                commit_message = 'populating test3 yo!')
```




# dir_M <- c('Windows' = '//mazu.nceas.ucsb.edu/ohi',
#            'Darwin'  = '/Volumes/ohi',    ### connect (cmd-K) to smb://mazu/ohi
#            'Linux'   = '/home/shares/ohi')[[ Sys.info()[['sysname']] ]]
